# DefenseIQ

DefenseIQ-tech-learning platform is a full-stack cybersecurity/tech related learning platform that combines spaced repetition, AI-assisted study, progress analytics,
and hands-on labs to help students, developers, and security professionals learn technical concepts.

## What this project demonstrates:

- full-stack application architecture
- monorepo organization
- API design with Express and TypeScript
- Next.js frontend structure
- PostgreSQL data modeling
- CI/CD automation with GitHub Actions
- deployment readiness with Vercel and Render
- security-minded engineering decisions
- technical product documentation

## Core features

- Study dashboard
- Flashcard review flow
- Spaced repetition engine scaffold
- Deck marketplace

Local setup

1. Start infrastructure
docker compose up -d postgres redis

2. Run backend
cd apps/api
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm run dev

3. Run frontend
cd apps/web
npm install
npm run dev

4. Run worker
cd apps/worker
npm install
npm run dev

Deployment

Recommended deployment targets:
- Frontend: Vercel
- Backend API: Render Web Service
- Worker: Render Background Worker
- Database: Render Postgres

Security notes

See:
- docs/SECURITY_ARCHITECTURE.md
- Current security-minded design includes:
- environment variable based secrets
- JWT auth scaffolding
- input validation
- CORS restrictions
- basic rate limiting middleware
- separation of frontend, API, worker, and database concerns

CI/CD
